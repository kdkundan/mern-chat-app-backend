# MERN Chat App Backend

This is the backend part of the MERN Chat App, a real-time chat application. It's built using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, and Socket.IO for real-time bi-directional communication.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model and scales easily.

- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

- **Node.js**: An open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. Used for secure user authentication.

- **Socket.IO**: A JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
